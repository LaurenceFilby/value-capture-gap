# The Value Capture Gap Framework

A revolutionary behavioral economics visualization revealing systematic inefficiency in compensation markets.

## Overview

This framework identifies a fundamental market failure: the persistent gap between **value created** and **value captured** across all income levels. It provides the first systematic model for understanding why talented individuals are systematically underpaid and what levers exist to correct this.

## The Core Insight

Compensation at any point in time sits between two bounds:
- **Upper bound**: Value you create for the business/market
- **Lower bound**: Your market alternative (what you could earn elsewhere)

Where you land between these bounds is determined by:
1. Information asymmetry (employers know your value better than you do)
2. Negotiation power imbalances
3. Measurement difficulty (long-term value creation is poorly quantified)
4. Behavioral biases (status quo bias, anchoring, loss aversion)

## The Visualization

**Interactive chart showing US income distribution:**
- Median (50th percentile)
- Top 10%
- Top 1%
- Top 0.1%
- Top 0.01%

**For each percentile, you can see:**
- **Thick line**: Actual compensation received
- **Thin upper line**: Value created (ceiling)
- **Thin lower line**: Market alternative (floor)
- **Light shading above**: Uncaptured value (opportunity)
- **Darker shading below**: Employer pressure zone

## Key Findings

1. **Gap exists at every level** - Even top 0.01% earners systematically undercapture value
2. **Gap widens at extremes** - Higher earners create disproportionately more value than they capture
3. **Time dimension matters** - Value creation and compensation follow different trajectories
4. **Three intervention classes** exist to improve outcomes

## Three Ways to Improve Your Position

### Class I: Expand the Bargaining Range (raise your floor)
- Skill acquisition → increases alternative opportunities
- Career transition → accesses higher-value markets
- Entrepreneurship → removes employer constraints
- Market signaling → reveals true alternative value

### Class II: Increase Value Creation (raise your ceiling)
- Innovation, productivity gains, strategic contributions
- **Critical caveat**: Only improves compensation if measurement systems link value to pay
- Otherwise merely widens the gap

### Class III: Improve Capture Efficiency (move toward ceiling)
- Quantify your impact (solve measurement problem)
- Negotiate strategically (address power asymmetry)
- Reform compensation structure (profit-sharing, equity, performance-linked pay)
- Make value creation visible

## Theoretical Foundation

This framework integrates:
- Classical labor economics (reservation wage)
- Marginal productivity theory (value creation)
- Behavioral economics (bounded rationality, information asymmetry)

Into a unified decision framework with specific intervention points.
