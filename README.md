# The Value Capture Gap Framework

An empirical framework for analyzing compensation efficiency across income distributions.

## Overview

This framework examines a persistent economic phenomenon: the measurable gap between **value created** and **value captured** in labor markets. Drawing on behavioral economics, labor theory, and empirical income data, it provides a systematic model for understanding compensation dynamics and identifying optimization strategies.

## The Core Insight

At any point in a career, compensation operates within a bounded range:
- **Upper bound**: Marginal value produced for the organization
- **Lower bound**: Best alternative employment opportunity (reservation wage)

Position within this range reflects:
1. Information efficiency (visibility of individual contribution)
2. Market structure (competitive dynamics, switching costs)
3. Attribution complexity (difficulty measuring long-horizon value creation)
4. Behavioral factors (anchoring effects, status quo bias, negotiation dynamics)

## The Visualization

**Interactive analysis of US income distribution:**
- Median (50th percentile)
- Top 10%
- Top 1%
- Top 0.1%
- Top 0.01%

**Each trajectory displays:**
- **Solid line**: Realized compensation
- **Upper boundary**: Estimated value contribution
- **Lower boundary**: Market alternative (reservation wage)
- **Upper band**: Unrealized value capture potential
- **Lower band**: Retention margin (compensation premium above alternatives)

## Key Observations

1. **Universal phenomenon** - Value capture gaps persist across all income levels
2. **Non-linear scaling** - Gap magnitude increases disproportionately at higher percentiles
3. **Temporal dynamics** - Value creation and compensation follow distinct trajectory patterns
4. **Systematic interventions** - Three distinct strategy classes for optimizing outcomes

## Optimization Strategies

### Strategy I: Expand the Opportunity Set (raise lower bound)
- Human capital investment → enhances alternative employment options
- Sector transition → accesses higher-value labor markets
- Direct value capture → entrepreneurship reduces intermediation
- Credible signaling → reduces information asymmetry about alternatives

### Strategy II: Increase Marginal Productivity (raise upper bound)
- Innovation and process improvement
- Strategic contribution and decision rights
- **Critical constraint**: Effectiveness depends on attribution mechanisms
- Gap expansion risk: Value creation without corresponding capture infrastructure

### Strategy III: Improve Capture Efficiency (optimize position within range)
- Quantification systems → solve measurement and attribution problems
- Strategic negotiation → address power asymmetries
- Structural alignment → equity participation, performance linkage, profit-sharing
- Transparency initiatives → reduce information gaps

## Theoretical Foundation

This framework synthesizes:
- **Classical labor economics**: Reservation wage theory, competitive equilibrium
- **Marginal productivity theory**: Value attribution and compensation justification
- **Behavioral economics**: Bounded rationality, information asymmetry, cognitive biases

The result is an actionable decision framework with empirically testable intervention points.

## Methodology

Built using Python/Plotly with data modeled from:
- US Census Bureau income statistics
- Bureau of Labor Statistics compensation surveys
- Academic literature on income distribution and productivity

Interactive visualization enables exploration of:
- Career trajectory patterns by percentile
- Dynamic relationships between value creation and capture
- Comparative analysis across income levels

## Usage

Access via browser to explore the interactive model:
- Hover for precise values at any career point
- Toggle percentile visibility via legend
- Zoom/pan to examine specific ranges or time periods

## Applications

**For individuals**: Systematic framework for career optimization and negotiation strategy

**For organizations**: Diagnostic tool for compensation structure analysis and retention risk assessment

**For researchers**: Empirical foundation for studying labor market efficiency and compensation dynamics

**For policymakers**: Evidence base for understanding income inequality mechanisms and intervention design
